Programs to compute conjunctive normal forms (CNFs) of Boolean cardinality
constraints of the form <=k(x_1,...,x_n).

ParCounter: uses a parallel binary counter circuit
SeqCounter: uses a sequential unary circuit

Compile programs using 'make'.
Run programs with two command line parameters: <k> and <n>; output is written
to stdout, so typical usage is, e.g.
  ParCounter 3 100 > card.cnf
