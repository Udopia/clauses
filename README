In order to BUILD the tools in this repository:

1. Navigate to the directory 'minisat/solver' of the submodule Minsat and run the following three commands: 
  git submodule init 
  git submodule update
  make
2. Navigate back to the root of the repository and run:
  make

You get 4 EXECUTABLES that are all based on structure analysis in terms of nested gates:

1. cnf2aig: outputs the result in the AIGER format
2. cnf2dot: outputs the result as a graph in the graphviz format
3. metrics: outputs some metrics on the recognized structure
4. geninp: outputs the input variables of the recognized nested gates structure
